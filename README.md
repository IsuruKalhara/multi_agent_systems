# Multi Agent Systems(MAS) using different frameworks

This is an assignment of Agent Systems for the M.Sc. in AI program. Under this project, it is subjected to demonstrate features of MAS using implementing a simple application in different platforms.

MESA, osBrain and PADE used to implement LifeOfNuwan application where a person called Nuwan is try
in to achieve his life goals with his limited salary. Each person is implemented as an agent which communicate with Nuwan.

Netlogo is used to implement COVID spreading situation

### MESA

[MESA](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/) is an Apache2 licensed agent-based modeling (or ABM) framework in Python.

It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools.

### osBrain

[osBrain](https://osbrain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about.html) is a general-purpose multi-agent system module written in Python.

Agents run independently as system processes and communicate with each other using message passing. Message passing is implemented using Ã˜MQ, and in particular, the PyZMQ Python bindings.

### PADE (Python Agent DEvelopment framework)

[PADE](https://pade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a framework for development, execution and management of multi-agent systems environments of distributed computation.

PADE is 100% written in Python language and uses the Twisted libraries for implementing the communication between the network nodes.
